    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin slipped below $91,000 during Hong Kong afternoon trading before finding tentative support at $90,267, marking a 2.9% decline that erased much of the week's earlier gains \u2014 the pullback came on unremarkable volume, suggesting profit-taking rather than conviction selling.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum underperformed the market leader with a 4.6% drop to $3,199, widening the ETH/BTC ratio to levels not seen since early November \u2014 a pattern that typically emerges when risk appetite contracts and capital rotates toward perceived safety.\n\n\u2022 Solana bore the brunt of the session's weakness, shedding 5.8% to $131, with on-chain data showing elevated transfers to exchanges during Singapore hours \u2014 the kind of positioning that often precedes further volatility.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation contracted to $3.17 trillion while Bitcoin dominance edged up to 56.9%, the familiar flight-to-quality dynamic playing out in miniature as smaller assets bled more than majors.\n\n\u2022 Liquidation data remained relatively contained despite the move, with roughly $180 million in long positions cleared across major exchanges \u2014 orderly enough to suggest this was a positioning adjustment rather than a leverage flush.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The dollar index held firm near two-week highs through Asian hours, maintaining pressure on risk assets after Friday's stronger-than-expected US jobs data complicated the Federal Reserve's rate path \u2014 crypto continues to trade as a high-beta dollar proxy.\n\n\u2022 US Treasury yields stabilised after their post-payrolls surge, with the 10-year holding above 4.4%, a level that historically correlates with reduced institutional appetite for digital assets.\n\n\u2022 Spot Bitcoin ETF flow data from Friday's US session showed modest net outflows of approximately $120 million, breaking a three-day inflow streak \u2014 the reversal coincided with broader equity weakness and may set the tone for Monday's US open.\n\n\u2022 European Central Bank officials speaking over the weekend signalled continued caution on rate cuts, adding to the global theme of higher-for-longer that has tempered enthusiasm across speculative assets.",

    "the_session": "\u2022 Bitcoin slipped below $90,500 during Hong Kong afternoon trading, briefly touching $90,189 before finding tentative support \u2014 a level that marked the floor of last week's consolidation range and now faces its first serious test since the post-election rally.\n\n\u2022 Ethereum's 1.5% decline proved relatively contained compared to the broader altcoin complex, with ETH maintaining the $3,100 handle while Solana bore the brunt of risk-off positioning, shedding 4.4% as traders rotated out of higher-beta exposure.\n\n\u2022 Total market capitalisation contracted by $64 billion to $3.16 trillion, though BTC dominance held steady at 57% \u2014 suggesting the pullback reflects broad de-risking rather than any specific rotation between assets.\n\n\u2022 Liquidation data showed $180 million in long positions unwound over the past 12 hours, concentrated in the Asian afternoon session, though the figure remains modest by recent standards and suggests orderly repositioning rather than forced selling.",

    "the_macro": "\u2022 The DXY dollar index extended gains into a third consecutive session, pressing toward 107 as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut expectations following last week's hawkish minutes \u2014 a headwind for risk assets that has proven particularly acute for crypto in recent cycles.\n\n\u2022 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their first net outflow day in two weeks on Friday, with $240 million leaving the products ahead of the weekend \u2014 a data point that filtered through Asian sentiment as Monday trading commenced.\n\n\u2022 Treasury yields stabilised after Friday's moves, with the 10-year holding near 4.42%, though the curve's persistent inversion continues to signal recession concerns that complicate the institutional case for risk-on positioning.\n\n\u2022 Oil's slide below $69 on demand concerns added another deflationary signal to the macro picture, creating a mixed backdrop where lower energy costs support consumer spending but weaker growth expectations temper risk appetite.",

    "the_lead": "Bitcoin retreated to $90,177 overnight as Asian markets took profits following last week's push toward $94,000, with selling pressure accelerating through the Hong Kong close before European desks largely stood aside. The 2.1% decline looks orderly on the surface\u2014no liquidation cascades, no exchange outages, no panic in funding rates\u2014but the composition matters more than the magnitude. Solana's 4.4% drop led the altcoin retreat, while Ethereum's relatively muted 1.8% decline suggests institutional positioning remains anchored in the assets that matter for ETF narratives. Total market capitalization shed $51 billion to $3.16 trillion, yet 24-hour volume at $112 billion indicates this was repositioning, not exodus. The setup entering US hours is a market that ran hard last week and is now testing whether domestic institutions view sub-$90,000 as a buying opportunity or a warning. BTC dominance holding at 57% tells you the rotation trade hasn't begun\u2014capital isn't fleeing to alts, it's either staying in Bitcoin or leaving entirely. Today hinges on whether US spot ETF flows confirm that institutional conviction survived the weekend, or whether Monday brings the first meaningful redemptions since the post-election euphoria began.",

    "the_angle": "The consensus is focused on whether Bitcoin holds $90,000\u2014a round number that means nothing except to algorithms and retail traders drawing lines on charts. The actual tell is ETH/BTC. At 0.0344, Ethereum is quietly compressing toward cycle lows against Bitcoin, which historically precedes one of two outcomes: either ETH catches a violent bid as rotation begins, or Bitcoin's dominance surge accelerates into something that breaks the altcoin market entirely. The $90,000 level is theatre. The ratio is the plot.",

    "the_driver": "\u2022 Last week's spot ETF inflows exceeded $1.8 billion across all products, the strongest weekly accumulation since March\u2014but Friday's flows slowed notably, raising the question of whether institutions were front-running anticipated weakness or simply running out of immediate deployment capacity.\n\u2022 The Federal Reserve's December meeting looms larger than the market is pricing, with CME futures now showing only 52% probability of a rate cut\u2014down from 70% two weeks ago\u2014creating a macro headwind that crypto has largely ignored while equities have not.\n\u2022 Coinbase premium flipped negative overnight for the first time in three weeks, a subtle but meaningful signal that US-based buyers are no longer willing to pay above global spot prices, suggesting the marginal bid has shifted offshore.\n\u2022 Options markets show December $100,000 calls still commanding significant open interest despite the pullback, indicating that the leveraged speculation cohort remains committed to the year-end breakout thesis even as spot markets cool.",

    "the_signal": "\u2022 Fear & Greed Index at 83 (Extreme Greed) \u2014 sentiment remains stretched despite the pullback, suggesting this decline hasn't shaken true believers, which cuts both ways for continuation.\n\u2022 BTC funding rates at +0.008% \u2014 nearly neutral after last week's elevated readings, indicating leveraged longs have been flushed without creating the negative funding that marks capitulation.\n\u2022 ETH/BTC at 0.0344 \u2014 compressing toward the 0.032 level that has historically triggered violent mean reversion, making this the ratio to watch for rotation signals.",

        "the_session": "Today's session was deceptively quiet on the surface. Bitcoin oscillated in a $1,500 range around $91,000, but beneath the calm, derivatives markets showed unusual activity that suggests positioning for a larger move. The character was consolidation rather than conviction—a market catching its breath after last week's volatility, with neither buyers nor sellers willing to force the issue.",
        "the_flows": "ETF flows painted a mixed picture that defies simple interpretation: BlackRock's IBIT saw $124 million in inflows while Grayscale's GBTC continued its slow bleed with $45 million out. Net positive, but barely—and nowhere near the conviction flows we saw in early November. More telling was perpetual funding rates flipping negative mid-session for the first time this week, suggesting leveraged longs have been systematically flushed. Perhaps most interesting: stablecoin flows into exchanges picked up meaningfully in the final two hours of trading. Someone is positioning, but the direction remains unclear.",
        "the_divergence": "The day's most intriguing anomaly: ETH outperformed BTC by nearly 2% despite no obvious catalyst or news flow. When ETH leads in a risk-off environment, it often signals rotation rather than retreat—capital moving down the risk curve rather than exiting entirely. Meanwhile, BTC dominance ticked down 0.3% to 54.2%. That's a small move in isolation, but noteworthy given the broader caution in the market. Someone is making a bet on relative value that contradicts the prevailing defensive positioning.",
        "the_regime_check": "Nothing fundamental changed today, which is itself informative. This morning's thesis—that the market is in distribution mode after November's rally—remains intact and arguably strengthened. The lack of follow-through buying on the early session dip to $90,200 confirms institutional hesitation to add exposure at these levels. We're still in wait-and-see territory, with the market clearly watching Friday's jobs data before committing capital in either direction.",
        "the_overnight_setup": "Watch the $90,000 level overnight—it's become the line in the sand. Asia opens with BTC just above this psychological floor, and thin overnight liquidity could amplify any move. A decisive break below likely triggers stop-losses clustered in the $89,000-90,000 range, potentially accelerating toward $87,500 support. Conversely, holding $90K through the Asian session and reclaiming $92,000 would suggest the consolidation is constructive rather than distributive. The skew in options markets slightly favors puts, but not dramatically.",
        "the_takeaway": "Today was a pause, not a resolution—the calm before a decision point. The real move is still ahead, likely this week, and Friday's macro data will probably be the catalyst."

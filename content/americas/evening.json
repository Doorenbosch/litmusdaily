    "the_day": "Bitcoin climbed above $91k while Ethereum reclaimed $3k, extending a broad rally across risk assets. Both majors posted their strongest single-day gains in over a fortnight. Volumes were elevated but not exceptional\u2014this was steady accumulation rather than speculative frenzy. No single catalyst dominated headlines; instead, a confluence of diminishing macro anxiety lifted sentiment.",
    "the_move_explained": "The rally appears rooted in stabilizing bond yields and softening dollar strength, both of which tend to precede crypto upside. Correlation with tech equities remained tight\u2014when Nasdaq rallied 1.8%, digital assets followed with beta. This wasn't crypto-native news driving price; it was macro conditions becoming less hostile.",
    "into_tonight": "Asian session liquidity will test whether this momentum holds without Western participation. Watch for profit-taking near resistance levels if volumes thin."

    "sections": {
        "the_lead": "The US session's 6% drop found no buyers in Asia. Bitcoin tested $84,500 before a modest bounce, but volume remained thin. The lack of dip-buying suggests institutions across time zones are aligned in their caution. Europe opens to a market that's now 12% off highs with no clear catalyst for reversal.",
        "the_mechanism": "ETF positioning in the US turned defensive, and Asian perpetual funding rates have flipped negative—traders are now paying to be short. This is a meaningful regime shift: when both spot and derivatives markets align bearishly, counter-trend rallies tend to be short-lived and shallow. The volume signature confirms: selling is happening on conviction, buying on hope.",
        "the_complication": "European crypto-focused funds present a potential counterweight. Several EU institutional vehicles have reported increased allocations in recent weeks, positioning ahead of MiCA clarity. If this capital deploys at current levels, it could provide the bid that Asian markets didn't. However, European institutional flows historically follow rather than lead price action.",
        "the_behavioral_layer": "The absence of panic is itself notable. Social engagement metrics show declining interest even as price falls—classic late-cycle behavior where volatility no longer attracts attention. This is different from March's correction, which saw engagement spike. The current indifference suggests a market exhausted by its own narrative rather than scared by price action.",
        "the_forward_view": "ECB's Lagarde speaks at 14:00 GMT on inflation outlook. While not directly crypto-relevant, risk appetite across European markets will take its cue from her tone. MiCA implementation updates from the European Commission are expected this week—clarity here could catalyze European institutional deployment. Watch $85,000 as the session pivot.",
        "the_closing_line": "Two sessions, same story: sellers in control. The question isn't whether to buy the dip—it's whether this is a dip or a trend change."

    "the_lead": "Bitcoin slipped below $90,500 during the Asian session, extending a methodical decline that began shortly after the US close yesterday. The move lacked drama \u2014 no liquidation cascades, no panic headlines \u2014 which is precisely what makes it notable. Ethereum underperformed on a relative basis, shedding 3.6% against Bitcoin's 2.5%, while Solana's 5.7% drop suggests risk appetite is being quietly withdrawn from the edges inward. Total market capitalisation now sits at $3.18 trillion, with $159 billion in 24-hour volume that feels more like repositioning than conviction.\n\nEuropean desks open to a market that has been selling for reasons nobody can quite articulate. There's no fresh regulatory threat from Brussels, no hawkish surprise from the ECB, no MiCA implementation deadline creating forced selling. The absence of obvious catalyst is itself the story. BTC dominance at 56.8% tells us capital is rotating defensively rather than exiting entirely \u2014 a distinction that matters for how you position into the US open.\n\nToday hinges on whether European institutional flows confirm or contradict the Asian session's verdict. If Zurich and London add to selling pressure, we're looking at something more structural than overnight noise.",

    "the_angle": "Everyone's focused on the percentage moves. Here's what they're missing: this selloff is too orderly. When markets decline on low volatility and unremarkable volume, it typically means the marginal seller isn't a panicked retail holder \u2014 it's someone with a spreadsheet and a mandate. The absence of fear is not bullish. It suggests methodical de-risking by institutions who don't need to sell today, but have decided they'd rather not own this into quarter-end. Polite exits precede impolite ones.",

    "the_driver": "\u2022 Spot ETF flows turned modestly negative on Monday, with net outflows of approximately $35 million \u2014 not alarming in isolation, but marking the third consecutive session of institutional hesitation after a strong February.\n\n\u2022 The ETH/BTC ratio continues compressing toward 0.0354, its weakest level since late 2023, as Ethereum's narrative struggles to compete with Bitcoin's institutional legitimacy and Solana's retail momentum.\n\n\u2022 Funding rates across major perpetual venues remain stubbornly neutral at +0.01%, suggesting neither longs nor shorts have conviction \u2014 a setup that typically resolves with a sharp move in whichever direction breaks first.\n\n\u2022 Middle Eastern sovereign wealth activity, which had been a quiet bid through February according to OTC desk chatter, appears to have paused \u2014 removing a support that few had priced in but many had relied upon.",

    "the_signal": "\u2022 Fear & Greed Index at 49 (Neutral) \u2014 the fastest sentiment reset from Greed territory since November, suggesting positioning has already adjusted even if price hasn't fully reflected it.\n\n\u2022 BTC 30-day realised volatility at 38% \u2014 historically low for a trending market, meaning the current calm is borrowed time rather than the new normal.\n\n\u2022 Open interest down 8% week-over-week \u2014 leverage is being withdrawn, which reduces liquidation risk but also removes the fuel for any reflexive bounce.",
